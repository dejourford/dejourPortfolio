<h1>PURPOSE</h1>
The purpose of this project is to build a responsive portfolio that shows that I am job ready. I am building this portfolio with inspiration from two different ideas that i've combined. I plan to create my own portfolio--and by that I mean not using a template. The portfolio should have a landing page with text on less opacity backgorund and maybe an "Find out More" button?
